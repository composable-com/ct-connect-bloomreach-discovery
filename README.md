The Bloomreach Discovery commercetools connector was created by [Orium](https://orium.com/), and provides the following features:

## Installing the connector

In order to install the connector in your commercetools project, you'll need to deploy it. Refer to the [commercetools connect deployment documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/concepts#deployments).

Setup the required environment variables when you [create the deployment](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/getting-started#create-a-deployment):
- `CTP_CLIENT_ID`
- `CTP_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `CTP_PROJECT_KEY`
- `CTP_SCOPE`
- `CTP_REGION`
- `BLOOMREACH_DISCOVERY_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `BLOOMREACH_DISCOVERY_AUTH_KEY`
- `BLOOMREACH_DISCOVERY_DOMAIN_KEY`
- `BLOOMREACH_DISCOVERY_API_KEY`
- `BLOOMREACH_DISCOVERY_CATALOG_LOCALE`

## Uninstalling the connector
In order to uninstall the connector, you’ll need to [send the appropriate HTTP request and delete it](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/deployments#delete-deployment).

This will trigger the [`preUndeploy` script](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/convert-existing-integration#preundeploy) which will delete the Import cron jobs and messages subscriptions described on the “Installing the connector” section.


## FAQ

### Where is the mapping for _products_ defined?
- We map the commercetools products data into Bloomreach in `src/services/bloomreach-discovery-catalog-ingestion.ts`.

### Why do we need the `BLOOMREACH_DISCOVERY_CATALOG_LOCALE` env variable?
- By default, commercetools has built-in i18n support. In order to consume the catalog data, we must specify the desired [`LocalizedString`](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/types#localizedstring).
